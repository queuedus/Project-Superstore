# Project-Superstore
This analysis is based on the shopping data of a store. it consists of over 9,000 rows of data about customers, orders, sales amongst others. I have carried out a detailed analysis to highlight the important elements of the data.
This repository consist of the raw data file: Sample-Superstore, a jupyter notebook file (superstore_report.ipynb) which contains the codes i ran for my analysis.
The report of the analysis was then presented in easily understandable word, pdf and Excel formats.
